DieEating is an iOS Application to help you plan your **personalised diet** for whole week. The app offers 3 types of diets based on your personal preferences for specific products, like diary or meat, and health data from Health App on iOS (HealthKit framework). 

Each diet consists of recipes provided by K Group API. The diet plan for each day cover contains enough calories for you to keep your weight on the same level.

The recipes contain preparing instruction, list of ingridients and some nutritional information. 

What is more, once having access to all ingridients for whole week the shopping list is presented. A DieEating can use a map to find closest K Group shops and look at the shopping list for selected diet plan.

## Hackathon K Group Challenge

> We are interested in receiving innovative new ideas for digital services which could help our customers to live in a more healthy, sustainable and convenient way. 
> We prefer concepts that utilise our data resources innovatively and motivate our customers to keep sharing their data with us. Design from a customers’ point of view as well as the respect for data privacy are implicit.

More about it on Junction 2018 [website](https://2018.hackjunction.com/challenges/health-sustainability-and-convenience-through-data)

## Product potential
- Automation of healthy diet.
- DieEating may be far more beneficial by providing delivery services from groceries.
- DieEating can be used as a Food Diary.
- Having all nutritional information the user can easily log all his consumed food by choosing the corresponding meal (recipe) from his plan.

## About HealthKit Usage
We use Customer's weight, height, age, sex and his active and resting energy to calculate  basal metabolic rate and total energy intake per day in calories. 
In future, the DieEating can write nutrition data of consumed meals to HealthKit as part of Food Diary feature.

## Building source code 

Unfortunately, K Group closed its API right after the Junction 2018 ended, so the DieEating backend is down currently. 
However, you might be interested in watching the [demo](https://vimeo.com/302641782)! or mocking the server responses in source code.
